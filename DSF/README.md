# Deliver Secure and Fast (DSF) – Requirements Specification

This folder contains the **requirements specification document** for the project **Deliver Secure and Fast (DSF)**, created as part of the **Software Design course**.

---

##  Description

The **DSF Requirements Specification** defines the scope, functionality, and constraints of a logistics and parcel delivery system.  
It documents the **functional and non-functional requirements**, **system interfaces**, **business rules**, and **use cases** to guide future system design and implementation.

**File:**
- `Deliver-Secure-and-Fast-(DSF)-Requirements-Specification.pdf`

##  Contents of the Specification

1. **System Requirements**
   - Stakeholders and concerns
   - Functional requirements (e.g. account management, parcel tracing, payment processing)
   - Non-functional requirements (e.g. scalability, reliability, security, availability)

2. **System Interfaces**
   - User interfaces (web & mobile, responsive, accessible)
   - Interfaces to external systems (payment gateways, GPS, CRM, logistics systems)
   - Hardware interfaces (barcode scanners, network infrastructure)

3. **Business Rules**
   - Customer loyalty discount
   - Customs compliance check
   - Parcel damage claims

4. **System Constraints**
   - Tech stack (Node.js, MongoDB, React, React Native)
   - Compliance & security (GDPR, PCI DSS, OAuth2, 2FA)
   - Environmental sustainability

5. **Use Cases**
   - Sending a trackable parcel (private customer)
   - Business customer sending a parcel
   - DSF staff returning an undelivered parcel

6. **Appendix**
   - Time report of report preparation and revisions

##  Purpose

This document was prepared to:
- Capture and formalize **requirements** for the DSF system  
- Ensure clarity, completeness, and feasibility of system functionality  
- Provide a **blueprint for system design and development**  
- Practice **requirements engineering** as part of the Software Design course
